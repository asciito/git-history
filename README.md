# Brief Description

This a project created with NextJS and TailwindCSS, so as simple as it sounds the project doesn't need a lot of configuration or any kind of witchery.

The project make a lot of assumptions with my descriptions on every commit, and for that I don't mind to be specific in that area.

## Getting Started

First, you need to download the project or cloned it, and then enter to the project folder and run the next command:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

This command is used to install all the dependencies for the project.

Once all the dependencies are installed, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Then go to the specified url, in this case its http://localhost:3000

At that's it, now you can see my project in action.

## Production Mode

To create the production build just run:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

Once the project has been compiled, then you need to run the command:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

Then the project will start at 'http://localhost:300' by default.
And that's it, now you can deploy the application.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy this project with Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out their [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
